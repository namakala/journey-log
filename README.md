  - Scoping review following bibliometrics analysis
- Slide:
  - Speech is ok, but slide is too fast
  - Keep the point you’d like to discuss as the main focus of the slide
- Hanneke from RIVM creates a scoping review on system dynamic model in
  healthcare $\to$ In the later phase of my scoping review, I should
  consider having an FGD with RIVM team
- Umbrella review:
  - Preserve the outliers when analyzing the data
  - Create a pairplot and do descriptive analysis from data with
    preserved outliers:
    - Variables:
      - IV: Prevalence
      - DV: Year of publication, region, and psychometric instrument
  - When fitting metaregression: Set region, year of publication, and
    psychometric instrument as covariates
  - Consider extracting the dataset and perform clustering analysis

## 2023-10-05

- Umbrella review:
  - Do not remove outliers
  - Use GBD data to calculate the relative risk of having depression in
    T2DM
  - Complete the data analysis sub-section in the manuscript
  - Storytelling:
    - Do umbrella review on 23 studies $\to$ Fetch all the primary
      studies
    - Redo meta-analysis, see that the variance is too high
    - We attempted to explain the variance $\to$ Subgroup meta-analysis
      and meta-regression
    - The heterogeneity is 2% explained by year, meaning that overtime
      the prevalence of depression is increasing among T2DM patients
    - Interestingly, the GBD data shows that MDD prevalence stays the
      same while T2DM is increasing overtime
    - The increasing MDD prevalence in T2DM might be explained by T2DM
    - Data from GBD also shows increasing risk of depression in T2DM
      patients
- IADB:
  - Continue breaking down the source codes
  - Plan a meeting with Talitha and Jens

## 2023-09-29

- Meeting with Prof. Mako should be rescheduled to 20 or 27 October
- Umbrella review:
  - Anomaly detection:
    - Instead of removing the outliers based on 95% CI, it’s better to
      apply outlier detection algorithm
    - Use IQR as a criteria
    - Span the results based on year, do a five-year rolling window
  - Metaregression:
    - Standardize the covariance, they should have the same range
    - Year: Set the smallest value of year as an index year
    - Experimental model: Fit a model without $\beta_0$
    - Addressed concerns:
      - Pooling of proportion from all entries:
        - Do we really want to pool over all studies? That is, do we
          think we can find a single estimate of the prevalence of MDD
          in T2DM that would be relevant worldwide and irrespective of
          outcome or time.
        - Maybe here the proportion as a measure of prevalence differs
          from an effect measure, where you may reasonably assume it to
          be independent of setting in principle.
        - Maybe when we combine all the 634 studies, this gives us the
          global average, which of course reflects a lot of
          heterogeneity (as we may expres by presenting a histogram). We
          should then ensure not to take more than one proportion from
          each study. (so it will be less than 634).
        - Maybe that is more relevant than taking only the studies that
          are closest together (to avoid heterogeneity). Since we do
          expect and understand heterogeneity.
      - Subgroup analysis:
        - Do we indeed expect that once we concentrate on country, we
          can expect to pool? I would be inclined to think so, but as
          you show, also time, outcome measure and maybe more do matter.
        - So question: Once you stratify by country: can we combine
          studies into a setting specific average? Is homogeneity
          sufficient? If not, does it make sense to select studies based
          on being no outlier? Or would it be more appropriate to
          further stratify for factors that will explain heterogeneity,
          like time of study and outcome measure?
      - Next approach to explore:
        - About the pooling. Another factor that could explain
          heterogeneity is underlying prevalence of MDD and of T2DM.
        - Next to outcome measure, that may also be a matter of risk
          profile of the population (e.g. obesitas).
        - So could you and Nora also find the expected prevalence (by
          country/by time), based on published prevalence estimates of
          MDD and of T2DM (using GBD, WHO, OECD or IHME published
          numbers, whatever is most clear and consistent); calculate the
          expected proportion of MDD in T2DM based on such prevalences
          and then start doing the meta-regression on the remainder (So
          the additional prevalence of MDD over what you may expect) or
          maybe on the RR (the crude proportion divided by the expected
          proportion) or Odds Ratio.
        - Possibly this latter measure is one that you may expect to be
          the same irrespective of time or setting more reasonably,
          since it is more of an effect measure (the effect of T2DM on
          MDD risk). So then it becomes more reasonable to use
          established methods of meta-regression packages, which were
          initially developed for pooling effect measures.
        - For the analysis of the observed proportions, I think it is
          mostly the heterogeneity that you need to show in the results:
          SO how this varies indeed by country (a map would be great),
          by outcome measure etc.
        - If you take more than one outcome per study, how could you
          take account of the dependence these will have? Multilevel
          analysis an option? Or using clustered standard errors??
  - Analyzing RR:
    - Get the prevalence of MDD in the general population based on year
      and/or country $\to$ Check GBD or IHME
    - RR = Prevalence of MDD in T2DM, as reported, divided by the
      prevalence of MDD in the general population
    - Compare the RR for each subgroup
  - Bayesian meta-analysis:
    - Use half-cauchy distribution as a prior for SE
    - Use beta distribution as a prior for the proportion
- IADB:
  - Breakdown the toolbox, check what each lines do
  - Formulate questions to discuss with Jens
- Check courses for meta-regression
